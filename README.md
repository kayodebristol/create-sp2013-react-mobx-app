Opinionated SharePoint 2013 starter kit for modern client-side Javascript development. 
This project extends Facebooks create-react-app, but adds SharePoint 2013 specific modules.

````
npm install --global create-sp2013-react-mobx-app
````
or 
````
yarn add --global create-sp2013-react-mobx-app
````

Once installed, use the cli to create a new project. 
````
create-sp-2013-react-mobx-app my-new-project-name
````


### Prerequisites

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
It's very helpful if you have access to SharePoint 2013, since this is a SharePoint development starter kit.
Although the generated project will work with SharePoint 2016, it is not optimized for SharePoint 2016 or Online. 
Please see my other starter kits for those platforms.
